Name & Description \\ 
  \hline
bin & Missing values are currently silently dropped. \\ 
  bin2d & Count number of observation in rectangular bins. \\ 
  bindot & Missing values are currently silently dropped. If weights are used, they must be integer values. \\ 
  binhex & Bin 2d plane into hexagons. \\ 
  boxplot & Calculate components of box and whisker plot. \\ 
  contour & Calculate contours of 3d data. \\ 
  density & 1d kernel density estimate. \\ 
  density2d & 2d density estimation. \\ 
  ecdf & Empirical Cumulative Density Function \\ 
  function & Superimpose a function. \\ 
  identity & Identity statistic. \\ 
  qq & Calculation for quantile-quantile plot. \\ 
  quantile & Continuous quantiles. \\ 
  smooth & Aids the eye in seeing patterns in the presence of overplotting. \\ 
  spoke & Convert angle and radius to xend and yend. \\ 
  sum & Sum unique values. Useful for overplotting on scatterplots. \\ 
  summary & stat\_summary allows for tremendous flexibilty in the specification of summary functions. The summary function can either operate on a data frame (with argument name fun.data) or on a vector (fun.y, fun.ymax, fun.ymin). \\ 
  hex & Apply function for 2D hexagonal bins. \\ 
  summary2d & Apply function for 2D rectangular bins. \\ 
  unique & Remove duplicates. \\ 
  ydensity & 1d kernel density estimate along y axis, for violin plot. \\
